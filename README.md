# End-to-End-Big-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-Project
An end-to-end big data engineering pipeline built on AWS, leveraging EMR and Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, S3 for scalable storage, and Redshift Serverless for analytics-ready data validation and querying.
# Architecture Flow
Local System → S3 → EMR (Spark) → S3(Transformed data) → Redshift Serverless
# Step 1: EMR Cluster Creation
